# Binary Numbers

Binary numbers represent data using only two digits: 0 and 1. This system is foundational in digital technology.

## Basics of Binary
- **Two States**: 0 and 1 can represent electrical off and on states.
- **Place Values**: Binary numbers increase by powers of 2 from right to left.

### Binary Addition
- `0 + 0 = 0`
- `1 + 0 = 1`
- `1 + 1 = 10` (carry the 1)
