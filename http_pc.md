# HTTP Protocol and PC Components

In addition to the basics of digital systems, let's briefly explore the HTTP protocol, which enables web communication, and the key components inside a personal computer.

## HTTP Protocol
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data exchange on the web.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates communication between web browsers and servers.
- **Structure**: Requests and responses are sent in plain text, including methods like GET, POST, and DELETE.

## Key PC Components
Modern computers rely on several core components:
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain of the computer, executing instructions.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary storage that helps the CPU access data quickly.
- **Hard Drive/SSD**: Long-term storage for files, programs, and the operating system.
